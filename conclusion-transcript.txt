CONCLUSION TRANSCRIPT:

JAMIE: I was actually kind of disappointed we didn’t set the boat on
fire. We’ve got plenty of sun.  We’ve got plenty of mirrors to do the
trick. But here’s the thing: Mythbusters is about
experimentation. It’s not about demonstration. And when I was in the
middle of this experiment out on that boat with all those mirrors
shining in my face, I realized something really important: and that is
that they were actually quite distracting and blinding, even
painful. And that right there may be the grain of truth at the heart
of this myth. Good old Archimedes may not have come up with this trick
in order to set a ship on fire but rather to distract and disorient
invading armies. And that says something really important about the
nature of experimentation. When we experiment, when we try things, and
we fail, we start to ask why, and that’s when we learn.
